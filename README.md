This map shows the first 20 restaurants returned from the Yelp API based on the bounds of the map.  The initial map
shows Hoover, AL.  However, the user has the ability to input any location they wish and the map will update based on 
what they enter.  The restaurants returned will also update based on the bounds of the new map location.

In the list view, the user will see the restaurant name, the Yelp user rating, and the phone number.

To narrow down their search, the user has a couple options.
1.  The user can click on the restaurant in the list
2.  The user can click on the marker on the map.

When either of those 2 things occur, the list view will narrow down the restaurant they selected, the marker on the map will turn blue, and an info window will pop up which shows the name of the restaurant and an image from Yelp.

If the user wants to unfilter the list, they can click on the Refresh List link at the bottom of the list.  If the user clicks on that link, all the restaurants will again be displayed in the list.
